# ðŸ’¿ Mifasol

âš  *Right now Mifasol is in an alpha stage.*

Mifasol is a self-hosted *opinionated* music server.

![mifasolcli console user interface](docs/mifasolcli-ui-screenshot.png)

Its main purpose is to meet these objectives :

1. To manage songs and playlists on a self-hosted server.
2. To keep song and playlist files on different clients synced with server content.
3. To avoid playlists being broken updating song's name, album's name, artist's name or reorganizing song files hierarchy.
4. Not to impose a particular music player to listen your music (thanks to the files sync).
5. To be easy to
    1. Install (statically compiled)
    2. Backup (embedded database)
    3. Secure (https by default)
6. To be multiplatform (different OS or Architecture: Windows/Mac/Linux/Raspbian)

Mifasol is a free and open source project distributed under the permissive Apache 2.0 License.

### Opinionated

This software doesnâ€™t try to satisfy the needs of everyone.

- The number of features is voluntarily limited to facilitate its maintenance.
- Only **flac** and **mp3** formats are supported (**ogg** may come later).
- When you import some music on mifasol server, **song filenames are ignored**, only tags are used to link your song to an artist, an album or to known the song name.
- Once your music is imported, **song tags are partially managed by mifasol server** and are used to generate song filename on mifasol clients.
- **Only one-way sync is supported**:  song files and playlists are copied from mifasol server to mifasol clients.
- Homonym artists and albums are differentiated.
- Each song can be linked to **multiple artists** but only one album.

## Mifasol server

### Installation

#### From prebuild binaries

Drop the dedicated `mifasolsrv` binary on your server and you are done.

On first launch, `mifasolsrv run` will:
- Create default admin user with mifasolcli/mifasolcli as username/password
- Create a self-signed certificate valid for localhost only
- Listen client requests on https://localhost:6620

#### Configuration

If you want to access your server from both https://mypersonaldomain.org:6630 and https://77.77.77.77:6630, you should configure mifasolsrv accordingly with:

```
mifasolsrv config -hostnames mypersonaldomain.org,77.77.77.77 -n 6630 -enable-ssl
```

#### More options

```
mifasolsrv --help
mifasolsrv <COMMAND> --help
```

## Mifasol client

### Installation

#### From prebuild binaries

Drop the dedicated `mifasolcli` binary on your client.

#### From sources

You need golang >= 1.13 and
- `libasound2-dev` on linux
- `mingw-w64` on windows
- `AudioToolbox.framework` on mac

```
go install mifasol/cmd/mifasolcli
```

### Usage

#### Configuration

On first launch, *mifasolcli* try to connect to mifasol server using https://localhost:6620
(only accepting server self-signed certificate read on first connection) with mifasolcli/mifasolcli as username/password.

You can change default configuration with:

```
mifasolcli config -hostname <HOSTNAME> -n 6620 -u mifasol -p mifasol
```

NB: \<HOSTNAME\> should match with one of the hostnames configured on mifasol server.

#### Import music folder content to mifasol server

```
mifasolcli import [Location of music folder to import]

```
mifasolcli filesync sync [Location of folder to synchronize]
```

#### Console user interface

Run console user interface to manage and listen mifasol server content:

```
